In fact, I can't really remember much about it since then, except that we used shrimp, and now I feel bad about that because the original recipe posts it up as vegan. I shouldn't feel bad, but I'm also making a concerted effort that these recipes be vegetarian or vegan. I've been thinking about those terms a lot. I rarely eat meat these days, and now my decision not to is becoming more intentional and political. So, I guess that comes with a bit of guilt. So yeah. Anyway. It was pretty good."
