- This recipe has a lot going on at once. If you are good at multitasking it
  might go quickly. I wouldn't know. Anyway. We'd recommend pressing the
  tofu first and then starting the coconut rice, both of which take 20-25
  minutes. Also, when you grill the tofu, don't cut it too thick. If the tofu is
  bland, you could use some BBQ sauce.

- This could probably be a good side but we don't think it turned out super
  well. We don't have a BBQ right now so we used a pan. This made the asparagus
  a bit limp. We also probably over-doused it in the miso sauce... if you were

4) Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook the rice according to package
   instruction. Remember, brown rice takes longer than most other rices.

   with starch until tofu is evenly coated.
6) [&: Bake tofu | 00:30:00] Put tofu in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes until golden on the edges.
7) Prepare the peanut sauce: mix Peanut butter, 3 tbsp of squeezed lime juice,
   soy sauce, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir. Thin
   with water if needed.
8) Prepare the salsa. In a mixing bowl, combine: mango, bell pepper, onion,
   jalapeno, lime juice, salt and cilantro. Stir.
9) Prepare your bowl: add rice first, then a handful of the shredded cabbage,
   then salsa, then tofu, then drizzel with peanut sauce.

- Eggplant is hard to prepare. Or so I have been told. We had never steamed it until this recipe. Still, with the accompanying sauce, the meal turned out totally fine. I think I'll need to order more eggplant at restaurants to know what to look for in a successful eggplant dish. On another note, shredded eggplant might not be the most visually appealing ingredient to some; if presentation matters quite a bit to you, make sure you have the green onions and maybe get both black and white sesame seeds to top.
