[Ari's Garden](https://arisgarden.theiceshelf.com/) is a site for collecting and displaying the journey of making and
discovering food.

Using Ari's Garden, you can find recipes and use dynamic features like tooltips
and timers to help you cook.

## Building / Process 

**Requirements**

1. Elm 0.19.1
2. Node >= 7.x.x

**Steps to Getting Started**

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

**Adding new recipes/images**

- Recipes are stored in `src/scripts/recipes.org`. All recipes must follow the same general schema.
- `convert.js` is used to turn `recipes.org` into `src/scripts/db.json`
- sequences of images can be turned into gifs using `ImageMagick's` `mogrify` command:

```sh
mogrify -resize 400 *.JPG

convert -delay 5 -loop 0 *.JPG output.gif
```
  
### Notes on adding new pages.

When adding a new (stateful) page, you have to make a few changes. A page is a "mini-version" of The Elm Architecture.

- *File*: Create a new file + namespace in Pages/<your_page.elm> with:
    - a model
    - an update + types
    - a view
- *Routing* Add the page + it's types to the Router and it's parser.
- *Main* Update main with the mini TEA into the main TEA:
    - Refactor Update to handle passing the sub state around, and map commands.o=
    - Map.html for subviews.
    - Add the sum of the msg types to the union types under Types.elm ( Naming ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è))
